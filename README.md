*"It will be alright."*

“Omori” is a game that tackles tough themes. The story is about a boy named Sunny who pieces together a lost truth, both in reality and in his dreams. He is replaced in Headspace by a boy named Omori, who matches his appearance somewhat. The player is shown how this lost truth affected Sunny, and how his mental health deteriorated because of it. 

Its a turn-based role-playing game at its core. You’re given control of Omori (or, in some cases, Sunny), and his friends Kel, Aubrey, and Hero. Each character equips different weapons and takes different roles in battle. For example, Aubrey hits hard while Kel uses skills to set up for future attacks, and Hero keeps the team’s health from reaching zero. Omori himself is a good all-rounder, allowing for decent damage with balanced stats.

The game represents depictions of anxiety, depression, and mental serious health issues. The depictions in this game are crucial to the narrative and are not present simply for the “scare” factor. However, it doesn’t stop the fact that the themes in this game are heavy. If you are sensitive to this kind of content, it’s okay to refrain from experiencing this game if you feel uncomfortable from any of these factors.
